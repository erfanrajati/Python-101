    "The most simple explanation of variables, is to say they are like containers, able to store pieces of data. Of course there are countless reasons for why we should store data in the first place. For starters, programming is the art of playing with data and use them to engineer something useful; and variables are surely the first step in learning how to work with data.\n",

    "Very cool huh? Notice that `+` is a so called *Operator* in Python. We will discuss operators in next session more deeply. Just keep in mind that operators might act differently if they are used with strings rather than numbers. As you witnessed, using `+` with string variables resulted in sticking two strings together, whereas with numbers, it added them mathematically. We will talk about the main differences between strings and numbers (and other types there might be!) but before that, let us add one last application of variables, getting the user input!"

It can be a string (which we also learned), like user's name, home address, email addres, etc. However, in the Digital World, data can have many other forms. Like for example a boolean, meaning a data that can be either true or false. Like someone's gender or whether or not they are above 18, if a book is sold out or still in-stock, so on and so forth. Data can also be a combination of simpler types of data, like a key-value structure data; which a great example for would be a phonebook, which relates each name to a phone numner (a string to a number) In this topic, we're to explain what a Data Type is and which ones are the basic ones in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, when you declare a variable, you give it a *Name* and assign a *Value* to it. Like in `a = 10`, `a` here is the variable's name and `10` is it's value. Right now we're to learn that variables actually come with a third property called their *Data Type*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as name and value, each variable has a data type which is essentially the \"type of data\" that is currently stored in that variable. For instance, the DataType of `a` in the example above is *Integer*; which is a fancy name for whole numbers like `10`. Another example would be `name = \"Erfan\"` which has a Data Type of *String*.\n",
