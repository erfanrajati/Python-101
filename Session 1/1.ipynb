For starters, programming is the art of playing with data and use them to engineer something useful; and variables are surely the first step in learning how to work with data.\n",

As you witnessed, using `+` with string variables resulted in sticking two strings together, whereas with numbers, it added them mathematically. We will talk about the main differences between strings and numbers (and other types there might be!) but before that, let us add one last application of variables, getting the user input!"

For instance, the DataType of `a` in the example above is *Integer*; which is a fancy name for whole numbers like `10`. Another example would be `name = \"Erfan\"` which has a Data Type of *String*.\n",
