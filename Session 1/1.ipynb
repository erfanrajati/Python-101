    "The most simple explanation of variables, is to say they are like containers, able to store pieces of data. Of course there are countless reasons for why we should store data in the first place. For starters, programming is the art of playing with data and use them to engineer something useful; and variables are surely the first step in learning how to work with data.\n",

    "You must pay attention to do's and don'ts when it comes to naming variables. For example, you variable name can only contain letters, numbers and `-` which is called a *dash*. You can't have space in you variable's name or special characters like: `!`, `@`, `#`, etc. There are a couple more restrictions for naming variables which we'll get to later on.\n",

    "Very cool huh? Notice that `+` is a so called *Operator* in Python. We will discuss operators in next session more deeply. Just keep in mind that operators might act differently if they are used with strings rather than numbers. As you witnessed, using `+` with string variables resulted in sticking two strings together, whereas with numbers, it added them mathematically. We will talk about the main differences between strings and numbers (and other types there might be!) but before that, let us add one last application of variables, getting the user input!"
